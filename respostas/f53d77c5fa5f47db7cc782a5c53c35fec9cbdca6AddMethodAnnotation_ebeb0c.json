  "prompt_original": "You are a powerful model specialized in refactoring Java code. Code refactoring is  the process of improving the internal structure, readability, and maintainability of a software codebase without altering its external behavior or functionality. Refactor the code below using the following technique: **Add Method Annotation**.\n\nRules:\n- Preserve the original functionality.\n- Return **only the complete refactored code**.\n- Do not include any explanations or comments,. only the code. \n- The code must be enclosed in a valid code block.\n\n### Original Code:\n```java\nindex 83aa74f0eb5..0bd3d90a06d 100644\n--- a/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/model/AggregateDefinition.java\n+++ b/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/model/AggregateDefinition.java\n  */\n @XmlRootElement(name = \"aggregate\")\n @XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)\npublic class AggregateDefinition extends ProcessorDefinition<AggregateDefinition> {\n     @XmlElement(name = \"correlationExpression\", required = true)\n     private ExpressionSubElementDefinition correlationExpression;\n     @XmlElement(name = \"completionPredicate\", required = false)\n         return this;\n     }\n \n    /**\n     * Setting the executor service for executing the sending the aggregated output.\n     *\n     * @param executorService the executor service\n     * @return the builder\n     */\n     public AggregateDefinition executorService(ExecutorService executorService) {\n         setExecutorService(executorService);\n         return this;\n     }\n \n    /**\n     * Setting the executor service for executing the sending the aggregated output.\n     *\n     * @param executorServiceRef reference to the executor service\n     * @return the builder\n     */\n     public AggregateDefinition executorServiceRef(String executorServiceRef) {\n         setExecutorServiceRef(executorServiceRef);\n         return this;\n```\n\nRefactored Code:",
