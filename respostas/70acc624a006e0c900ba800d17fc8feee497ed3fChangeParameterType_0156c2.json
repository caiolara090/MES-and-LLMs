  "prompt_original": "You are a powerful model specialized in refactoring Java code. Code refactoring is  the process of improving the internal structure, readability, and maintainability of a software codebase without altering its external behavior or functionality. Refactor the code below using the following technique: **Change Parameter Type**.\n\nRules:\n- Preserve the original functionality.\n- Return **only the complete refactored code**.\n- Do not include any explanations or comments,. only the code. \n- The code must be enclosed in a valid code block.\n\n### Original Code:\n```java\nindex ae859f6dc41..40802a5d1a9 100644\n--- a/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/file/GenericFileExclusiveReadLockStrategy.java\n+++ b/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/file/GenericFileExclusiveReadLockStrategy.java\n  * <ul>\n  * <li>GenericFileRenameExclusiveReadLockStrategy waiting until its possible to\n  * rename the file.</li>\n  * </ul>\n  */\n public interface GenericFileExclusiveReadLockStrategy<T> {\n```\n\nRefactored Code:",
  "resposta": "I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. You haven't provided any Java code that needs refactoring. Could you please provide the specific part of your Java code that you want me to refactor using \"Change Parameter Type\" technique?\n"
