  "prompt_original": "You are a powerful model specialized in refactoring Java code. Code refactoring is  the process of improving the internal structure, readability, and maintainability of a software codebase without altering its external behavior or functionality. Refactor the code below using the following technique: **Modify Class Annotation**.\n\nRules:\n- Preserve the original functionality.\n- Return **only the complete refactored code**.\n- Do not include any explanations or comments,. only the code. \n- The code must be enclosed in a valid code block.\n\n### Original Code:\n```java\nindex bcf11fc372f..8325ec6fd33 100644\n--- a/platforms/karaf/commands/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/karaf/commands/EndpointList.java\n+++ b/platforms/karaf/commands/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/karaf/commands/EndpointList.java\n /**\n  * List the Camel endpoints available in the Karaf instance.\n  */\n@Command(scope = \"camel\", name = \"endpoint-list\", description = \"Lists all Camel endpoints.\")\n public class EndpointList extends OsgiCommandSupport {\n \n     protected static final String HEADER_FORMAT = \"%-20s %-20s %-20s\";\n```\n\nRefactored Code:",
