  "prompt_original": "You are a powerful model specialized in refactoring Java code. Code refactoring is  the process of improving the internal structure, readability, and maintainability of a software codebase without altering its external behavior or functionality. Refactor the code below using the following technique: **Change Return Type**.\n\nRules:\n- Preserve the original functionality.\n- Return **only the complete refactored code**.\n- Do not include any explanations or comments,. only the code. \n- The code must be enclosed in a valid code block.\n\n### Original Code:\n```java\nindex 1c6155be35b..2d0213e8399 100644\n--- a/components/camel-spring/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/spring/CamelBeanPostProcessor.java\n+++ b/components/camel-spring/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/spring/CamelBeanPostProcessor.java\n     }\n \n     protected void injectMethods(final Object bean, final String beanName) {\n        ReflectionUtils.doWithMethods(bean.getClass(), new ReflectionUtils.MethodCallback() {\n            @SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\n             public void doWith(Method method) throws IllegalArgumentException, IllegalAccessException {\n                 setterInjection(method, bean, beanName);\n                 getPostProcessor().consumerInjection(method, bean, beanName);\n```\n\nRefactored Code:",

This change allows for better exception handling and makes it explicit that this method may throw exceptions which are not handled in the calling code. However, please ensure you handle these exceptions at all levels where this method could potentially be called to prevent potential runtime errors.\n"
