Code refactoring is  the process of improving the internal structure, readability, and maintainability of a software codebase without altering its external behavior or functionality. Refactor the code below using the following technique: **Change Parameter Type**.\n\nRules:\n- Preserve the original functionality.\n- Return **only the complete refactored code**.\n- Do not include any explanations or comments,. only the code. \n- The code must be enclosed in a valid code block.\n\n### Original Code:\n```java\nindex 8bbf0179cd4..1266159f3c4 100644\n--- a/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/model/ProcessorType.java\n+++ b/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/model/ProcessorType.java\n      * @return the builder\n      */\n     public Type setExchangePattern(ExchangePattern exchangePattern) {\n        addOutput(new ExchangePatternType(exchangePattern));\n         return (Type) this;\n     }\n```\n\nRefactored Code:",
