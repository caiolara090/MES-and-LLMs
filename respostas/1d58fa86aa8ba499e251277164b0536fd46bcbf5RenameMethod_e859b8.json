  "prompt_original": "You are a powerful model specialized in refactoring Java code. Code refactoring is  the process of improving the internal structure, readability, and maintainability of a software codebase without altering its external behavior or functionality. Refactor the code below using the following technique: **Rename Method**.\n\nRules:\n- Preserve the original functionality.\n- Return **only the complete refactored code**.\n- Do not include any explanations or comments,. only the code. \n- The code must be enclosed in a valid code block.\n\n### Original Code:\n```java\nindex 380ba4561ef..a958f6d8fe2 100644\n--- a/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/Exchange.java\n+++ b/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/Exchange.java\n      *\n      * @param handoverOnCompletion whether the on completion callbacks should be handed over to the new copy.\n      */\n    Exchange newCopy(boolean handoverOnCompletion);\n \n     /**\n      * Copies the data into this exchange from the given exchange\n```\n\nRefactored Code:",
