  "prompt_original": "You are a powerful model specialized in refactoring Java code. Code refactoring is  the process of improving the internal structure, readability, and maintainability of a software codebase without altering its external behavior or functionality. Refactor the code below using the following technique: **Add Class Annotation**.\n\nRules:\n- Preserve the original functionality.\n- Return **only the complete refactored code**.\n- Do not include any explanations or comments,. only the code. \n- The code must be enclosed in a valid code block.\n\n### Original Code:\n```java\nindex 6565887af28..4f5c0d8bc27 100644\n--- a/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/impl/MDCUnitOfWork.java\n+++ b/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/impl/MDCUnitOfWork.java\n \n     @Override\n     public AsyncCallback beforeProcess(Processor processor, Exchange exchange, AsyncCallback callback) {\n        return new MDCCallback(callback);\n     }\n \n     @Override\n         private final AsyncCallback delegate;\n         private final String routeId;\n \n        private MDCCallback(AsyncCallback delegate) {\n             this.delegate = delegate;\n            // we only need to keep track of route id as we may change routes during routing\n            this.routeId = MDC.get(MDC_ROUTE_ID);\n         }\n \n         public void done(boolean doneSync) {\n```\n\nRefactored Code:",
