  "prompt_original": "You are a powerful model specialized in refactoring Java code. Code refactoring is  the process of improving the internal structure, readability, and maintainability of a software codebase without altering its external behavior or functionality. Refactor the code below using the following technique: **Change Parameter Type**.\n\nRules:\n- Preserve the original functionality.\n- Return **only the complete refactored code**.\n- Do not include any explanations or comments,. only the code. \n- The code must be enclosed in a valid code block.\n\n### Original Code:\n```java\nindex ae859f6dc41..40802a5d1a9 100644\n--- a/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/file/GenericFileExclusiveReadLockStrategy.java\n+++ b/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/file/GenericFileExclusiveReadLockStrategy.java\n  * <ul>\n  * <li>GenericFileRenameExclusiveReadLockStrategy waiting until its possible to\n  * rename the file.</li>\n  * </ul>\n  */\n public interface GenericFileExclusiveReadLockStrategy<T> {\n```\n\nRefactored Code:",
  "resposta": "Apologies for any confusion, but there seems to be a misunderstanding as your original code does not seem related to Java programming. It appears to be part of a Git diff output that describes changes made to a file in the Apache Camel project. However, without more context or specific details about what you want to achieve with this refactoring, it's hard to provide a precise solution.\n\nIf you are interested in general Java programming and how to refactor code using a technique such as **Change Parameter Type**, here is an example of that:\n\nOriginal Code:\n```java\npublic void printLength(String str) {\n    System.out.println(str.length());\n}\n```\n\nRefactored Code:\n```java\npublic void printLength(Object obj) {\n    if (obj instanceof String) {\n        String str = (String) obj;\n        System.out<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>println(str.length());\n   }\n}\n```\nThis refactoring changes the parameter type from `String` to `Object` and then checks at runtime whether it's a `String` before attempting to call `length()` on it, which ensures that the code will not crash if another type is passed in. It also demonstrates how you can use a technique such as **Change Parameter Type** to improve the readability of your code while preserving its original functionality and behavior.\n"
