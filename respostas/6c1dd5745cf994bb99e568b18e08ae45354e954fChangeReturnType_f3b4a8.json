  "prompt_original": "You are a powerful model specialized in refactoring Java code. Code refactoring is  the process of improving the internal structure, readability, and maintainability of a software codebase without altering its external behavior or functionality. Refactor the code below using the following technique: **Change Return Type**.\n\nRules:\n- Preserve the original functionality.\n- Return **only the complete refactored code**.\n- Do not include any explanations or comments,. only the code. \n- The code must be enclosed in a valid code block.\n\n### Original Code:\n```java\nindex 7b05dcc7db2..d9fc96bf335 100644\n--- a/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/management/DefaultInstrumentationAgent.java\n+++ b/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/management/DefaultInstrumentationAgent.java\n import javax.management.remote.JMXServiceURL;\n \n import org.apache.camel.impl.ServiceSupport;\nimport org.apache.camel.spi.InstrumentationAgent;\n import org.apache.camel.util.concurrent.ExecutorServiceHelper;\n import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;\n import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;\n /**\n  * Default implementation of the Camel JMX service agent\n  */\npublic class DefaultInstrumentationAgent extends ServiceSupport implements InstrumentationAgent {\n \n     public static final String DEFAULT_DOMAIN = \"org.apache.camel\";\n     public static final String DEFAULT_HOST = \"localhost\";\n```\n\nRefactored Code:",
  "resposta": "The original code cannot be refactored to change its return type as per the rules provided because it's not a method call but class definition and initialization. But if we were dealing with a method, which is more common in programming context, here's an example of how you could possibly refactor this:\n\n### Original Code (Method):\n```java\npublic int someMethod() {\n    return 5; // Return type was Integer previously\n}\n```\n\n### Refactored Code (Method with Change Return Type to `int`):\n```java\npublic int someMethod() {\n    return 5;\n}\n```\nIn this refactoring, we changed the return type of the method from `Integer` to `int` as per the rules provided. The functionality remains unchanged but the returned data type is different now. But again as per your question, I mentioned a class definition and it cannot be modified in that context.\n"
