  "prompt_original": "You are a powerful model specialized in refactoring Java code. Code refactoring is  the process of improving the internal structure, readability, and maintainability of a software codebase without altering its external behavior or functionality. Refactor the code below using the following technique: **Rename Method**.\n\nRules:\n- Preserve the original functionality.\n- Return **only the complete refactored code**.\n- Do not include any explanations or comments,. only the code. \n- The code must be enclosed in a valid code block.\n\n### Original Code:\n```java\nindex 0c21e23c43c..145f7a1eeb8 100644\n--- a/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/RouteBuilderTest.java\n+++ b/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/RouteBuilderTest.java\n         }\n     }\n \n    protected RouteBuilder<Exchange> buildStaticReceipentList() {\n         // START SNIPPET: e8\n         RouteBuilder<Exchange> builder = new RouteBuilder<Exchange>() {\n             public void configure() {\n         return builder;\n     }\n \n    protected RouteBuilder<Exchange> buildDynamicReceipentList() {\n        // START SNIPPET: e8\n         RouteBuilder<Exchange> builder = new RouteBuilder<Exchange>() {\n             public void configure() {\n                 from(\"queue:a\").recipientList(header(\"foo\"));\n             }\n         };\n        // END SNIPPET: e8\n         return builder;\n     }\n \n     public void testRouteDynamicReceipentList() throws Exception {\n \n        RouteBuilder<Exchange> builder = buildDynamicReceipentList();\n \n         Map<Endpoint<Exchange>, Processor<Exchange>> routeMap = builder.getRouteMap();\n         System.out.println(\"Created map: \" + routeMap);\n```\n\nRefactored Code:",
