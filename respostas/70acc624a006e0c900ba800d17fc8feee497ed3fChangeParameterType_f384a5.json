  "resposta": "I'm sorry, but your request is not clear enough. It seems like you want me to refactor a piece of Java code using the \"Change Parameter Type\" technique. However, without seeing the specific section of code that needs refactoring, it's difficult for me to provide an accurate and useful response. Could you please provide more details about the part of the code you would like me to refactor?\n"
