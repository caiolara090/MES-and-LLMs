  "prompt_original": "You are a powerful model specialized in refactoring Java code. Code refactoring is  the process of improving the internal structure, readability, and maintainability of a software codebase without altering its external behavior or functionality. Refactor the code below using the following technique: **Rename Method**.\n\nRules:\n- Preserve the original functionality.\n- Return **only the complete refactored code**.\n- Do not include any explanations or comments,. only the code. \n- The code must be enclosed in a valid code block.\n\n### Original Code:\n```java\nindex b1d034e26b2..90e7e4dc0f2 100644\n--- a/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/converter/IOConverter.java\n+++ b/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/converter/IOConverter.java\n         return toInputStream(buffer.toString(), exchange);\n     }\n     \n     /**\n      * @deprecated will be removed in Camel 3.0. Use the method which has 2 parameters.\n      */\n```\n\nRefactored Code:",
  "resposta": "The code you provided appears to have a deprecated method that could use renaming. The original method is `toInputStream(buffer.toString(), exchange)`, but it's been annotated with `@deprecated` and an explanation indicating it will be removed in Camel 3.0. Instead of keeping this method, you might want to create a new one which can replace the deprecated method.\n\nPlease provide more specific details about what should be done for me to assist you better.\n"
